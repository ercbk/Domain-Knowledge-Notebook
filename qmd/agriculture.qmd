        -   Incorporates extreme weather covariates and Bayesian Structural Time Series models to analyze crop yield dependencies across multiple regions
-   Commodity prices normally forecast using a cobweb model which leads to price risk
-   Vegetable price series are much more volatile than other commodities
    -   Seasonality regulates the supply and demand
    -   Perishable nature of the produce adds complications in stabalizing the price
