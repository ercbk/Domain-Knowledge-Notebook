        -   Incorporates extreme weather covariates and Bayesian Structural Time Series models to analyze crop yield dependencies across multiple regions

    -   [Method: Using generalized additive models in the livestock animal sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06281) by Simpson ([Repo](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gams-in-animal-science-manuscript))
        -   Shows how learning from data can produce a better fit to data than that of parametric models
        -   Shows how hierarchical GAMs can be used to estimate growth data from multiple animals in a single model
        -   Shows how hierarchical GAMs can be used for formal statistical inference in a designed experiment
-   Commodity prices normally forecast using a cobweb model which leads to price risk
-   Vegetable price series are much more volatile than other commodities
    -   Seasonality regulates the supply and demand
    -   Perishable nature of the produce adds complications in stabalizing the price
