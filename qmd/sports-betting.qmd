-   Steps to avoid getting picked off by bookmakers

    -   Notes from [Eliminate These Five Sharp Betting Tells From Your Game](https://unabated.com/articles/eliminate-these-five-sharp-betting-tells-from-your-game?ref=thepowerrank)
    -   Sharps tend to bet early and help shape a stronger line for books to present to the less-knowledgeable public betting crowd who will bet later.
        -   Solution: Instead of always betting when the opening line is published, bet when key events for that sport take place (e.g. when NFL injury report is published, when an informative site/person posts their report/info, etc.).
    -   Sharps tend to bet more underdogs than the public
        -   Public bettors like to bet on overs or the expected favorite to win the game. As a result, sharp bettors often find value in betting unders or underdogs
        -   Due to betting markets becoming more efficient, the Unders/Underdogs value is dissipating. In major sports, the underdog is covering right around 50-51% of the time. As a result, finding value on Overs/Favorites is possible.
        -   Solution: Keep records of the types of bets you make with each book. If you're betting more underdogs at a book, change your behavior which can be as simple as not betting there for a few days. Perhaps betting something in an unrelated sport. Or, when necessary, bet something without getting the best number in the market.
    -   Sharps tend to bet in amounts that return round numbers (e.g. bet \$110 to win \$100)
        -   Solution: Toss in some weird bet amounts make you look like you have less of a system.
    -   Sharps tend to bet straight bets only
        -   Solution: Mix in some parlays in positive expected value situations
    -   Sharps tend to get good Closing Line Value
