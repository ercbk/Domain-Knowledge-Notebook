    -   Sharps tend to bet early and help shape a stronger line for books to present to the less-knowledgeable public betting crowd who will bet later.
        -   Solution: Instead of always betting when the opening line is published, bet when key events for that sport take place (e.g. when NFL injury report is published, when an informative site/person posts their report/info, etc.).
    -   Sharps tend to bet more underdogs than the public
    -   Sharps tend to bet in amounts that return round numbers (e.g. bet \$110 to win \$100)
    -   Sharps tend to bet straight bets only
    -   Sharps tend to get good closing line value
