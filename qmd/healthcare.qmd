-   Populations within Healthcare Claims Data\
    -   Lines of business (LOB) such as patients with coverage from a government payer (Medicaid, Medicare); commercial lines (employer groups, retail or purchased via the exchange); self-insured (self-funded groups, usually large employers paying for their own healthcare claims of employees), etc.\
    -   Sub-lines of business, or groups. For instance, Medicaid may consist of multiple sub-groups representing different levels of eligibility, coverage, benefits, or types of people/why they qualified for the program (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) vs. Medicaid expansion for adults)\

## Terms {#sec-health-terms .unnumbered}

-   [**Biomedical Informatics**]{style="color: #009499"} - involves carrying out analysis on large-scale biological datasets in order to understand and profer solutions to health-related problems. Focuses on the optimal use of biomedical information, data, and knowledge for problem-solving and decision-making by employing computational and traditional approaches
-   [**Calibration**]{style="color: #009499"} - the agreement between the estimated and the "true" risk of an outcome. A well-calibrated model is one that minimizes residuals, which is equivalent to saying that the model fits the test data well. (This is just GoF. How well the model generalizes.)
-   [**Clinical Data Science**]{style="color: #009499"} - focuses on applying data science to healthcare with the goal of improving the overall well-being of patients and the healthcare system
-   [**Discrimination**]{style="color: #009499"} - the ability of a model to rank patients according to risk (Often measured by AUROC)

-   [**Endpoint**]{style="color: #009499"} - Outcome variable measured in a medical study. e.g. Death, stroke, or quality of life are good endpoints. Blood tests and images on scans are not good endpoints.
    -   A [**composite endpoint**]{style="color: #009499"} is one that consists of two or more events
        -   Example: death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalization due to heart failure
            -   So the binary outcome would be a 1 if either of those events took place or a 0 if they did not. Or in a survival model, time until either of those events.
            -   Issues

-   [**In Silico Modeling**]{style="color: #009499"} - Widely used in pharmaceutical research to simulate the interactions between drugs and their target molecules (e.g., proteins or enzymes). Researchers use computer programs to predict how potential drug compounds will interact with their targets and to identify potential drug candidates more efficiently.
    -   A Latin phrase that means "in silicon," and it's used to describe processes that are carried out on a computer or using computer simulations.
    -   Can be used to predict the toxicity of chemicals or compounds without the need for extensive animal testing. This is important for assessing the safety of new drugs or chemicals.
    -   Used to understand the function of molecular networks in metabolism, gene regulation, or signal transduction

The regulatory interactions can be of different type, i.e. we account for regulation of transcription, translation, RNA decay, protein decay and protein post-translational modification. sismonr then simulates the stochastic expression profiles of the different genes in these systems over time for different in silico individuals, where the individuals are distinguised by the genetic mutations they carry for each gene, affecting the properties of the genes. The user has control over the different parameters used in the generation of the genes, the regulatory network and the individuals."

-   [**Progression-Free Survival (PFS)**]{style="color: #009499"} - The length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. In a clinical trial, measuring the PFS is one way to see how well a new treatment works.
-   [**Progression-Free Survival Rate**]{style="color: #009499"} - The percentage of people who did not have new tumor growth or cancer spread during or after treatment. The disease may have responded to treatment completely or partially, or the disease may be stable. This means the cancer is still there but not growing or spreading.

## Prepocessing {#sec-health-preproc .unnumbered}

-   Categoricals and Codes\
    ![](./_resources/Healthcare.resources/image.png){width="630"} -
    -   Reconciling codes from various sources of data can be challenging because some coding systems are proprietary
        -   e.g. "Heart failure" may be "123" in one coding system and "1a2b3c" in another
        -   Solution: Tokenize data and create embeddings
            -   Works as long as each healthcare dataset uses a consistent set of coding systems for itself
    -   Tokenization
        -   Text
            -   Just split it by whitespaces.
            -   Example: "high glucose" becomes \["high", "glucose"\]
        -   Codes
    -   Embedding
        -   For every field in every healthcare concept, we build a vocabulary of a predefined size
            -   Creating a global vocabulary doesn't work because different fields carries distinct healthcare semantics
        -   Train an embedding for each token
        -   Embeddings are learnt jointly with the prediction tasks
        -   Choose the same embedding dimension for all fields within a given healthcare concept (easier for aggregating)
    -   Aggregate to a common time-step
        -   e.g. 1 hour or a few hours or can be tuned as a hyperparameter
        -   Take the average of all field embeddings in an instance (embeddings for a time step) to form the aggregated embedding for that instance
            -   Can also use median, etc. instead of mean
        -   If there are multiple instances of a concept, we can further average the instance embeddings to form the embedding for that concept
        -   Since the healthcare concepts are a predefined enumerated list, we can concatenate the concept embeddings together to form a fixed sized example.
        -   If a concept does not appear in the time-step, we just set its embedding to all 0s.
    -   Append timestamp feature to embedding
        -   The timestamp of the instances / training examples are not evenly spaced. When a particular event occurs and has significant clinical meaning, it's not captured by the embeddings.
        -   Take the average of the timestamps of all instances in the time-stamp, and append it to the end of the fixed size embedding we obtained via fields -\> instance, and instances -\> concept aggregation
            -   This part isn't completely clear to me. Need to check the Google AI paper
            -   I think it means average all the timestamps within each aggregated embedding and append it to the embedding
                -   Seems like the averaged timestame would need to be transformed into a numerical before being appended.

## Bias in Healthcare Claims Data

-   Notes from [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/healthcare-is-inherently-biased-b60bf00d4af7), (mini) [paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2800118)

    -   [{{]{style="color: goldenrod"}[biaslyze](https://biaslyze.org/){style="color: goldenrod"}[}}]{style="color: goldenrod"} - NLP Bias Identification Toolkit
-   Imbalance of patients or members represented in large healthcare datasets can make your results non-generalizable or (in some cases) flat out invalid.\
-   Goals should be: investigate the biases, mitigate as well as possible, and decide which insights are still valuable or meaningful despite these nuances\
-   Characteristics of data that lead to biases\
    -   Only includes any members/patients who actually *had* an incident/event for which the insurer processed a subsequent claim\
    -   Tends to over/underrepresent certain groups who are more likely to have chronic health problems, adverse social determinants of health, seek care,\
    -   Groups are reflective of the type of demographics your organization tends to serve or that you have a larger book of business in\
        -   Can cause over-and-under-representation of certain diseases
    -   Even companies within the same insurance sector may not have similar populations. Company business practices affect the types of populations within their data.\
        -   Our \[patients / members / employees / residents / etc.\] may not act similarly or even represent \[all patients / other groups / other types of employer s / other regions / etc.\]\
    -   Data is years old. Effects sizes in data that's 5 or 6yrs old may not be valid now.\
-   Types\
    -   Undercoverage bias - occurs when a part of the population is excluded from your sample.\
    -   Historical bias - occurs when socio-cultural prejudices and beliefs are mirrored into systematic processes \[that are then reflected in the data\].\
    -   Systemic biases - result from institutions operating in ways that disadvantage certain groups.\
-   Solutions\
    -   Augment or compare with outside data:  data sharing/collaboration or tapping into additional feeds such as health information exchange (HIE)\
    -   Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) - (see definition below) compare socio-economics and demographics of your dataset with  Census estimates and the SDOH variability seen for said zip codes.\
        -   Will determine the amount of reweighting/normalizing the data requires

## Fairness and Privacy {#sec-health-fairpriv .unnumbered}

-   Misc
    -   Notes from - [Algorithmic Bias in Healthcare and Some Strategies for Mitigating It](https://towardsdatascience.com/algorithmic-bias-in-healthcare-and-some-strategies-for-mitigating-it-835abe28df7)
    -   Bias - Systematic error due to incorrect assumptions
    -   Under-represented groups are most susceptible to the impacts of bias
    -   Deidentified clinical data sets are collections of observational patient data that have been stripped of all direct Patient Health Information (PHI) components. IRB permission is not necessary for access to deidentified clinical data sets.
    -   Clinical data sets with HIPAA restrictions include observational patient information such as dates of admission, discharge, service, and birth and death as well as city, state, zip codes with five digits or more, and ages expressed in years, months, days, or hours. Without a patient's consent or a HIPAA waiver, HIPAA-restricted clinical data sets may be used or shared for research, public health, or healthcare operations.
-   Biases to fairness
    -   Historical bias - when the data collected to train an AI system no longer reflects the current reality
        -   e.g. even though the gender pay gap is still an issue, it was worse in the past.
    -   Representation bias - depends on how the training data is defined and sampled from the population.
        -   e.g. the data used for training the first facial recognition system, mostly relying on white faces, which lead the model to have a hard time recognizing black faces and other dark-skinned faces.
    -   Measurement bias - occurs when training data features or measurements differ from real-world data
        -   e.g. where the data for image recognition is mainly collected from one type of camera while real-world data is from multiple types of cameras.
    -   Coding/human bias - this happens mostly when scientists dive deep into a project with their subjective thoughts about their study
        -   e.g. "non-white patients receive fewer cardiovascular interventions and fewer renal transplants", and "Black women are more likely to die after being diagnosed with breast cancer". [Source](https://www.jointcommission.org/resources/news-and-multimedia/newsletters/newsletters/quick-safety/quick-safety-issue-23-implicit-bias-in-health-care/implicit-bias-in-health-care/#.Y4VE3uzMJTY)
-   Strategies to mitigate bias
    -   Collecting and using diverse training data:
        -   Data non-representative of the real-world population is a common cause of bias.
        -   Collect and use diverse training data that accurately reflects the demographics, backgrounds, and characteristics of the population the algorithm will be used on.
    -   Test the algorithm for bias:
        -   Can be done using a variety of methods, including conducting bias audits and using fairness metrics to measure the algorithm's performance.
        -   Evaluate performance of model across demographic groups and not just the whole population.
    -   Use algorithmic fairness techniques:
        -   Pre-processing algorithms that adjust the data to reduce bias
        -   In-processing algorithms that make adjustments during the training process
        -   Post-processing algorithms that adjust the output of the algorithm to make it fairer
    -   Ensure transparency and accountability:
        -   Provide clear explanations of how the algorithm works
        -   Regularly review and update the algorithm to remove any biases that may have been introduced
        -   Provide mechanisms for individuals to challenge the decisions made by the algorithm.
    -   Engaging with diverse stakeholders
        -   e.g. individuals and communities that may be affected by the algorithm
        -   Understand their perspectives and incorporate their feedback into the design and implementation of the algorithm.
        -   Can help ensure the algorith accurately reflects the needs and concerns of the population it will be used on.
-   Examples of Algorithmic Bias
    -   UnitedHealth Group
        -   Developed a commercial algorithm in order to determine which patients would require extra medical care (patients with the greatest medical need).
        -   A bias in the algorithm reduced the number of black patients identified for extra care by more than half, and falsely concluded that black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients.
        -   [Race correlated with other factors]{.underline} such as historical healthcare expenditures to evaluate future healthcare needs, which made it reflect economic inequality rather than the true medical needs of patients.
    -   Drug discovery for Covid-19
        -   An AI system was developed to triage patients and expedite the discovery of a new vaccine
        -   The AI system was able to predict with 70 to 80% accuracy which patients are likely to develop severe lung disease
        -   The triage process was solely based on the symptoms and preexisting conditions of patients, which can be biased because of the disparities based on race and social economic status.
