# Location Selection {#sec-locsel .unnumbered}

## Misc {#sec-locsel-misc .unnumbered}

-   Customer research, market expertise & experience, and competitor location analysis can all help inform the important criteria for your business
-   [Tool](https://www.jordanbean.com/example-work#populationestimator) to calculate population density within a certain radius of a location
-   Might be more useful to aggregate smaller geographies into overlapping circular areas to compare candidates\

    -   Would have to decide how to handle geographies that are only partially enclosed in a circlular area
        -   Use a percentage?
        -   Include the whole thing?

## Factors {#sec-locsel-fact .unnumbered}

-   Understanding of the demographic or economic factors that must be in place to be successful
-   Examples of questions
    -   Do you need a large population?
    -   High income population?
    -   High presence of certain age brackets?
    -   Do you rely on office worker foot traffic?
    -   Is the presence of certain business types important (restaurants, healthcare facilities)?
-   Non-data factors
    -   Appropriate accessibility (car traffic/foot traffic, street frontage)
    -   Signage
    -   Availability and size of space
    -   Cost/affordability

## Location Profiles {#sec-locsel-locprof .unnumbered}

-   These are created for existing stores and locations or potential new stores

-   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Workforce and Demographic ![](./_resources/Location_Selection.resources/1-u7KtEJ5Gbi-zaDd5dwRlhQ.png){.lightbox width="632"}\
    ![](./_resources/Location_Selection.resources/1-KAR-xT1uxjSvNfxvpPBdiQ.png){.lightbox width="632"}

-   Other potential variables

    -   Customer median driving distance
        -   May also inform on the correct census geography to use
    -   Distance_to highways, business district, etc.

## Analysis {#sec-locsel-anal .unnumbered}

-   Use thresholds for any profile variables to help narrow the group of potential candidate locations to a managable number
    -   Might be useful to fit a decision tree to develop rules to use as thresholds
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}
        -   Zip Code Population of 25,000+
            -   May want to use census geographies other than zip code
        -   City Population of 150,000+
        -   Growing Population
        -   Household Income of \$75,000+
        -   High percentage of the population in the workforce
        -   High economic activity
        -   Primary industry of employment in White Collar
        -   Percentage millennial population
        -   Restaurant density
-   Score candidate locations
    -   Create weights for important profile variables and then calculate scores for each candidate location
        -   Methods for creating weights
            -   Wing it with domain knowledge
            -   Coefficients from a regularized regression of KPI \~ standardized_profile_vars could be used as weights
                -   Or feature importance, shapely values, etc. from tree model
            -   Correlation or association statistics as weights
    -   Order scores highest to lowest
        -   If more than one location is considered, then group_by a suitably-sized geography
-   Cluster candidate location profiles with current successful stores
    -   Candidate locations that are in the same cluster as your stores are the ones that should be considered
    -   Prominent features of the cluster(s) may indicate which profile variables are more important than others
-   Take top-n candidates and dig deeper:
    -   Competitor analysis
        -   Example questions
            -   How many competitors exist is location?
            -   Where are they located?
            -   How satisfied are consumers with the options that exist today?
                -   Which competitors are most popular, suggesting we may want to look in other areas?
                -   e.g. Google Map, Yelp, etc. reviews of competitors at this location
    -   Mapping may illuminate other considerations
        -   e.g. One location has large swaths of uninhabitable land --- is there enough population density for us to be successful?
    -   How close are these locations to your other stores?
        -   Could one leach customers from the other?
    -   Examine profiles of final candidates
        -   What are the primary differences?
        -   What are the best features?
