## Terms {#sec-epidemi-terms .unnumbered}

-   [**Case Line Lists**]{style="color: #009499"} - Data tables in which every line is a different case/patient, and columns record different variables of potential epidemiological interest such as date of events (e.g. onset of symptom, case notification), disease outcome, or patient data (e.g. age, sex, occupation).

## Disease Mapping {#sec-epidemi-dismap .unnumbered}

-   Goals
    -   Provide accurate estimates of mortality/incidence risks or rates in space and time
    -   Unveil underlying spatial and spatio-temporal patterns
    -   Detect high-risk areas or hotspots
-   Risk estimation using metrics such as Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) when analyzing rare diseases or low-populated areas are highly variable over time, so it's diffficult to spot patterns and form hypotheses
    -   SMR = Observed number of cases / Expected number of cases
        -   SMR \> 1: risk is greater than the whole region under study
        -   Guessing "Expected number of cases" is the average number of cases for the whole study region
-   Statistical models smooth risks by borrowing information from spatio-temporal neighbors
    -   The smoothed gradient over the entire study region makes it easier to detect patterns and form hypotheses than highly variable, local area metric estimates (e.g. SMR in a low populated county)
-   Traditional Models
    -   Types
        -   Mixed Poisson with conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors for "space" and random walk priors for "time" that include space ⨯ time interactions (Knorr-Held, 2000, Bayesian modeling of inseperable space-time variation in disease risk)
        -   Reduced rank multidimensional P-splines (Ugarte et al, 2017, One-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three dimensional B-splines to specify space-time interactions in Bayesian disease mapping)
    -   Issues
        -   Estimating the cov-var matrix becomes intractable with big data and many areas since the covariance must be estimated between each pair of areas
        -   CAR models assume the same level of spatial dependence between all areas which isn't likely.
-   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[bigDM](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/bigDM){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"}
    -   Scalable non-stationary Bayesian models for high-dim, count data
    -   Dependencies
        -   Uses {future} for distributed computing
        -   Integrated, nested laplace approximation (INLA) method through {R-INLA}
    -   K-order neighborhood model
        -   Breaks up local spatial or spatio-temporal domains so that estimations can distributed and local area dependencies (neighborhoods) can be accounted for.
        -   "Areas" are usually districts, counties, provinces, etc.
            -   Package does provide a method to create a "random" area grid
                -   Might be useful to compare a random grid model with the e.g. county model to see how much county boundaries influence the estimates
        -   Each local area model includes k adjacent areas which creates a partition
            -   The local area estimate is smoothed by taking information from the adjacent areas
            -   Adjacent areas also have estimate posteriors computed
            -   Each area will have multiple posterior estimates from local area models where the area is the local area or where it is the adjacent area
        -   Merge or don't merge estimate posteriors for each area
            -   Merge: use weights proportional to the conditional predictive ordinates (CPO) ???
            -   Don't Merge: Use the posterior marginal risk estimates of an area corresponding to the original submodel.
                -   i.e. use the posterior where the area is the "local area" in that local area model and not an adjacent area.
