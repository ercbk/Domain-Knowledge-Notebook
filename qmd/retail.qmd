Misc

-   DS Use Cases (intermediate level - data needs to be centralized and not siloed)
    -   Demand forecasting models for optimizing the stock levels.
    -   Market basket analysis models for creating better newsletter offers.
    -   Dynamic pricing models using competitors' prices for better pricing strategies.
    -   Customer segmentation model for better understanding our customers' shopping preferences and providing them with customized offers and loyalty discounts.
-   Approach to deciding on a store to close
    -   Considerations
        -   Catchment Area: How to define the area that matters around my store
        -   Store Network: What are the relationships between stores
        -   Predicting Sales Transfer of your Customers (aka Customer Retention)
            -   Overlap in catchment areas and understanding how customers behave in your store network can help in this estimation
        -   Predicting the Impact on Acquiring New Customers (aka Customer Acquistion)
        -   Bringing it together
            -   Calculate 1-year, 3-year impact of removing a particular store
            -   Rank these impacts to choose a store whose removal will have the least impact
        -   Measurement & Model Improvement
            -   e.g. including real estate data such as lease terms and market intelligence on competition and anchor stores
    -   Impact on Customer Retention
        -   Depends on the convenience and quality of other channels for doing business (such as online or in physical locations), customer loyalty to the company and its products, and market competition.
        -   If you have historical data on customer retention after a store closure, you can use catchment and store network features to predict what will happen with customer retention if you decide to close a particular store.
    -   Impact on Customer Acquistion
        -   For a particular store, take the its catchment area and remove any section that overlaps with another store's catchment.
            -   This area will not have any support from a brick-and-mortar perspective to help in your acquisition efforts
        -   Look at trends over time to get a sense of the relative importance of this store's area to the overall chain and whether you should build a digitally supported strategy to offset the loss of acquiring new customers at a fraction of your cost of operating a retail store at that location

Lead Scoring

-   Also see
    -   [Algorithms, Marketing](Algorithms,%20Marketing) \>\> Propensity Model and Uplift Score Model
-   Use case: identify customer cohorts that are unlikely to become paying customers and eliminate the low efficient outreach
-   Map User Journey
    -   Also see [Marketing](Marketing) \>\> Customer Journey
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: B2B![](./_resources/Retail.resources/image.png)
-   Questions
    -   Find customer's last touchpoint before conversion
        -   e.g. proof of concept in B2B
    -   Brainstorm on metrics that may correlate with conversion and form hypotheses
        -   e.g. metrics that describe user behaviors in proof-of-concept
    -   Which customer cohorts are likely to schedule sales calls with us and how do they behave *without* sales guidance
        -   i.e. which cohorts are more likely to convert if they are given a sales call
        -   look at how prospects behave in product trials and interact with marketing emails
-   EDA
    -   Plot metrics by cohort
    -   Calculate correlation of metrics to conversion
        -   Cohorts can be segmented by any grouping factor
-   Model
    -   If you have enough data, model conversion rate \~ predictors (beta regression?) or convert/no covert \~ predictors (logistic regression, ML, DL)
    -   Otherwise, weight cohorts by their correlations with conversion

Catchment

-   Refers to the sphere of influence from which a retail location, such as a shopping center, or service, such as a hospital, is likely to draw its customers.
-   Major considerations -- supply factors, market demand factors, drive time from customers, transportation access (e.g. interstate) and consumer interactions
-   Steps
    -   Use the customers that purchased at the store in the past 12 or 24 months *(you need to be the judge on timeframe based on your business model)*, and map them to where they live, e.g., at census block group level.
    -   If the area is massive, applying an optimization function, where you use a polygon and work to minimize the size of the area while keeping the cumulative percent of the total sales as large as possible. (70-80% of cumulative sales is typically optimal)
        -   Assume this optimization function takes into account the considerations mentioned above
-   Measuring the amount of competition in the given catchment area is useful
-   Catchment areas might overlap.

Store Network

-   Understanding how stores are connected beyond a catchment area is essential to make smarter optimization decisions (i.e. closing or opening stores).
-   Steps
    -   Pick a store and for each customer, note which of your other stores (including ecommerce) that customer has shopped at
        -   (typically) 3 types of customers:
            -   Customers who shop at this store exclusively
            -   Customers who spend the majority of their \$ with you at this store and spend a smaller amount at other stores, including e-commerce
            -   Customers who spend a small amount of their \$ at this store and spend the most significant amount at other stores, including e-commerce
        -   For the ones that have shopped at multiple locations, those are generally your more loyal and high-value customers.
    -   This data forms the basis of the network model
        -   If the network gets too complicated, then pruning by adding addition rules might be necessary
            -   e.g. establishing rule for a minimum amount spent to the store network
