-   Leaders should focus on 3 to 6 KPIs that will drive growth.
-   When a KPI's growth begins to stagnate, break up the KPI monolith into smaller, more meaningful (and hopefully, easier to optimize) segments

## Terms {#sec-kpis-terms .unnumbered}

-   [**Operationalization**]{style="color: #009499"} - A process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon that is not directly measurable (e.g. happiness), though its existence is indicated by other phenomena. It is the process of defining a fuzzy concept so as to make the theoretical concept clearly distinguishable or measurable, and to understand it in terms of empirical observations.

## General {#sec-kpis-gen .unnumbered}

-   [KPI characteristics]{.underline}
    -   Monotonic: you always want to drive them higher or lower
    -   Typically a summary statistic or rate
-   [Question that you should ask when determining which metrics should be your KPIs]{.underline}
    -   What do you want to know?
    -   How much do you need to know?
    -   Why do you want to know this?
    -   What is the value or impact between not knowing and knowing?
-   [Input $\rightarrow$ Output $\rightarrow$ Outcome Framework]{.underline}
    -   **Input Metrics**
        -   Provide information about the resources used to create a system or process
        -   Useful for evaluating the efficiency of a system or process
        -   What you control: amount of time you spend on a task, the quantity of materials used to produce something, etc.
        -   Outputs should be highly responsive to your inputs
    -   **Output Metrics**
        -   Provide information about the immediate results of a system or process
        -   Useful for evaluating the performance of a system or process
            -   Answers whether the system or process is producing the desired results.
        -   It should be clear how much your output would change for one additional unit of input.
        -   Very actionable but not fully under your control
        -   There is a causal link between your output and your outcome, so difficult to discover
            -   May require experimentation to determine causality
        -   Typically tracked daily
    -   **Outcome Metrics**
        -   North Star metrics (See Product Metrics \>\> Types)
        -   What you are aiming to move with all your activities.
        -   Typically requires multiple outputs to move
        -   Typically tracked monthly or quarterly
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Educational Program
        -   The number of teachers, their average seniority, the funding of the school (inputs) help drive the grades of the students and their consistency over time higher (output) which ultimately lead to more students graduating high school (outcomes).
-   [Industry Examples]{.underline}
    -   *Financial* --- Revenue growth, cash flow, burn rate, gross profit
    -   *Customer* --- Engagement rates, net promoter scores, acquisition costs, conversion rates
    -   *Support & Service* --- Turnaround time, mean time to resolve, SLA compliance, quality
    -   *Employee* --- Attrition and retention, satisfaction, engagement
    -   *Governance, Risk, & Compliance* --- Percent compliance to process, audit compliance, non-security incidents Issues
-   [Avoid incentivizing the wrong behavior]{.underline}
    -   As soon as someone's performance is linked to a metric --- it is fair game to expect them to try to move the metric, so it is up to the metric designer to make sure the 'rules of the game' are clearly articulated.
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Reducing the number of support tickets opened via email
        -   Potential Solution: Engineer makes it as hard as possible to contact the email support
        -   Unintended Consequence: Increasing the number of 'negative' social media interactions
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: You don't want to push your salespeople to sell without caring about the retention rate.
        -   e.g Car salesmen selling a lemon to a customer. Customer unlikely to return to buy another car.
    -   Solutions
        -   Pair metric with a guardrail metric (see Product Metrics \>\> Types)
            -   Examples
                -   Quantity (sales) + quality (retention rate)
                -   Short term metric (inventory level) + long term metric (# of shortages)
        -   Design a compound metric
            -   By taking into account multiple measurement, it cannot be easily gamed
            -   Can also include metrics you don't want move negatively (e.g. cost metrics, guardrail metrics, health metrics)
            -   For experiments that use this metric, you then create a binary decision rule to decide if your experiment is successful or not.
-   [Beware of Deceptive Metrics]{.underline}
    -   Correlation does not equal causation
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Someone discovers that the number of transactions is correlated w/higher revenue
        -   Company decides to make number of transactions a metric and starts trying to increase it.
            -   e.g. Retargeting former customers, offering discounts, etc.
        -   Revenue doesn't substantially increase after considerable effort and resources
        -   Analysis reveals that the revenue is being mostly driven by a few whales buying high-ticket items while the team's increase in transactions was mostly low-ticket items
        -   So, the strategy should've been to target more whales and not just trying to increase the number of transactions
-   [Checks]{.underline}
    -   Metric is precise (i.e. measurement isn't noisy)
    -   Metric is accurate (i.e. it properly depicts the phenomenon it is supposed to depict).
-   [Next Steps]{.underline}
    -   Figure out the best way to calculate these metrics
    -   Create dashboards to monitor them over time
    -   Set up alerts when thresholds are crossed
        -   Anomaly detection

## Driver Trees

-   AKA KPI Tree
-   It's a map of how different metrics and levers in an organisation fit together.
    -   On the far left, you have an overarching metric you want to drive. This is the ultimate goal you want all the teams to be working towards (e.g. North Star metric).
