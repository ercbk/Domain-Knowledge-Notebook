    -   [Meaningful metrics: How data sharpened the focus of product teams](https://blog.duolingo.com/growth-model-duolingo/)
    -   [Open Source does not win by being cheaper](https://github.com/getlago/lago/wiki/Open-Source-does-not-win-by-being-cheaper)
-   Open-Source solutions are great when a transparency problem is present
    -   SaaS tools need to process sensitive client data such as IP addresses, names, session recordings, etc., and in a world of increasing data regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPA), it can be daunting for third parties to store that data.
    -   Example: PostHog
        -   Options
            -   Self-host an analytics solution yourself
            -   Hire PostHog as a third party to do it, but with transparency into how that data is stored and how possibly migrating to self-hosted in the future would work.
        -   Many companies will still opt for a hosted model, but they do so now with assurances of how the software works---line by line---and the process of migrating to a self-hosted model in the future if necessary. It's not that open-source companies win by preventing the need for a third party; they win by allowing for the open audit of how it works.
-   Open Source can lean on the community to develop connections and extensions
    -   While the core product is typically maintained by a central engineering team, integrations or plugins are often built by community developers and then occasionally merged into the main branch.
    -   Conversely, closed-source solutions struggle with this because they rely on their engineering team. By tapping the community for feedback and help, open-source projects can also accelerate past closed-source solutions
-   Larger companies aren't worried about going out of business because a piece of software is too expensive. They might be price-conscious in terms of negotiating a contract in context of their budget, but most SaaS software is just a line item at the end of the day.
    -   What matters more is that the solution is (a) a good solution, (b) around for the long haul, and (c) easy to manage. And, unfortunately, deploying an open-source solution can be tricky to manage.
    -   Most open-source solutions aren't replacing a top-three line item, and therefore price isn't the north star deciding factor.
-   MongoDB eventually switched to a special SSPL license to add specific restrictions on Cloud Providers from distributing a service without contributing to the project, which isn't OSI approved, but is open-source practically).
    -   But why make this point? Well, splitting the hair between profit and usage is important to measuring long-term success. If a project gets great adoption but cannot drive revenue, it will die.

## User Segmentation {#sec-saas-userseg .unnumbered}

![](./_resources/SaaS.resources/image.png){width="432"}

-   Diagram of users based on their activity on the language learning software, "duolingo."
    -   See article for an example of a user journey
-   Activity States
    -   **New users**: learners who are experiencing Duolingo for the first time ever
    -   **Current users**: learners active today, who were also active in the past week
    -   **Reactivated users**: learners active today, who were also active in the past month (but not the past week)
    -   **Resurrected users**: learners active today, who were last active \>30 days ago
    -   **At-risk Weekly Active Users (WAU)**: learners who have been active within the past week, but not today
    -   **At-risk Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: learners who were active within the past month, but not the past week
    -   **Dormant Users**: learners who have been inactive for at least 30 days
-   Rates
    -   Retention Rates
        -   **New User Retention Rate (NURR)**: The proportion of day 1 learners who return on day 2. This day 2 transition puts these learners into another "active" state (Current User)
    -   **Deactivation Rates**: e.g. WAU or MAU loss rate
    -   **Activation Rates**: e.g. Reactivation or Resurrection rate
-   Process
    -   Classify all users (past or present) into an activity state each day
    -   Collect data: monitor rates of transition between states.
        -   These transition probabilities are monitored as retention rates, activation rates, and deactivation rates
    -   Use transition probabilities to create Markov model for simulations
-   Identify new metrics, through simulations of the Markov model, that - when optimized - are likely to increase a North Star or Primary metric.
    -   Example\
        ![](./_resources/SaaS.resources/image.1.png){width="233"}
        -   Simulation is for 3yrs into the future
        -   "Lever" is the parameter being increased
            -   In the sim, it's increased 2% month-over-month
        -   **Daily Active Users (DAU)** is the North Star metric that is being opitimized (i.e. increased)
        -   Interpretation: Increasing Current User Retention Rate (CURR) increases DAU by 75% over the next 3yrs
    -   Formulas at time, t
        -   **DAUt** = ReactivatedUsert + NewUsert + ResurrectedUsert + CurrentUsert
        -   **WAUt** = ReactivatedUsert + NewUsert + ResurrectedUsert + CurrentUsert + AtRiskWAUt
        -   **MAUt** = ReactivatedUsert + NewUsert + ResurrectedUsert + CurrentUsert + AtRiskWAUt + AtRiskMAUt
        -   **ReactivatedUsert** = ReactivationRatet \* AtRiskMAUt-1
        -   **ResurrectedUsert** = ResurrectionRatet \* DormantUserst-1
        -   **CurrentUsert** = (NewUsert-1 \* NURRt) + (ReactivatedUsert-1 \* RURRt) + (ResurrectedUsert-1 \* SURRt) + (CurrentUsert-1 \* CURRt) + (AtRiskWAUt-1 \* WAURRt)
        -   **DormantUsert** = (DormantUsert-1 \* DormantRRt) + (AtRiskMAUt-1 \* MAULossRatet)
        -   **AtRiskMAUt** = (AtRiskMAUt-1 \* ARMAURRt) + (AtRiskWAUt-1 \* WAULossRatet)
        -   **AtRiskWAUt** = (AtRiskWAUt-1 \* ARWAURRt) + (CurrentUsert-1 \* (1-CURRt)) + (ReactivatedUsert-1 \* (1-RURRt)) + (NewUsert-1 \* (1-NURRt)) + (ResurrectedUsert-1 \* (1-SURRt))
-   Perform A/B tests to see whether 1) the selected metric can be moved and 2) whether moving it actually moves the north star/primary metric
