-   Diagram of users based on their activity on the language learning software, "duolingo."
    -   See article for an example of a user journey
-   Activity States
    -   **New users**: learners who are experiencing Duolingo for the first time ever
    -   **Current users**: learners active today, who were also active in the past week
    -   **Reactivated users**: learners active today, who were also active in the past month (but not the past week)
    -   **Resurrected users**: learners active today, who were last active \>30 days ago
    -   **At-risk Weekly Active Users (WAU)**: learners who have been active within the past week, but not today
    -   **At-risk Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: learners who were active within the past month, but not the past week
    -   **Dormant Users**: learners who have been inactive for at least 30 days
-   Rates
    -   Retention Rates
        -   **New User Retention Rate (NURR)**: The proportion of day 1 learners who return on day 2. This day 2 transition puts these learners into another "active" state (Current User)
    -   **Deactivation Rates**: e.g. WAU or MAU loss rate
    -   **Activation Rates**: e.g. Reactivation or Resurrection rate
-   Process
    -   Classify all users (past or present) into an activity state each day
    -   Collect data: monitor rates of transition between states.
        -   These transition probabilities are monitored as retention rates, activation rates, and deactivation rates
    -   Use transition probabilities to create Markov model for simulations
-   Identify new metrics, through simulations of the Markov model, that - when optimized - are likely to increase a North Star or Primary metric.
    -   Example\
        ![](./_resources/SaaS.resources/image.1.png){width="233"}
        -   Simulation is for 3yrs into the future
        -   "Lever" is the parameter being increased
            -   In the sim, it's increased 2% month-over-month
        -   **Daily Active Users (DAU)** is the North Star metric that is being opitimized (i.e. increased)
        -   Interpretation: Increasing Current User Retention Rate (CURR) increases DAU by 75% over the next 3yrs
    -   Formulas at time, t
        -   **DAUt** = ReactivatedUsert + NewUsert + ResurrectedUsert + CurrentUsert
        -   **WAUt** = ReactivatedUsert + NewUsert + ResurrectedUsert + CurrentUsert + AtRiskWAUt
        -   **MAUt** = ReactivatedUsert + NewUsert + ResurrectedUsert + CurrentUsert + AtRiskWAUt + AtRiskMAUt
        -   **ReactivatedUsert** = ReactivationRatet \* AtRiskMAUt-1
        -   **ResurrectedUsert** = ResurrectionRatet \* DormantUserst-1
        -   **CurrentUsert** = (NewUsert-1 \* NURRt) + (ReactivatedUsert-1 \* RURRt) + (ResurrectedUsert-1 \* SURRt) + (CurrentUsert-1 \* CURRt) + (AtRiskWAUt-1 \* WAURRt)
        -   **DormantUsert** = (DormantUsert-1 \* DormantRRt) + (AtRiskMAUt-1 \* MAULossRatet)
        -   **AtRiskMAUt** = (AtRiskMAUt-1 \* ARMAURRt) + (AtRiskWAUt-1 \* WAULossRatet)
        -   **AtRiskWAUt** = (AtRiskWAUt-1 \* ARWAURRt) + (CurrentUsert-1 \* (1-CURRt)) + (ReactivatedUsert-1 \* (1-RURRt)) + (NewUsert-1 \* (1-NURRt)) + (ResurrectedUsert-1 \* (1-SURRt))
-   Perform A/B tests to see whether 1) the selected metric can be moved and 2) whether moving it actually moves the north star/primary metric
