-   Existing Tree Canopy: The amount of urban tree canopy present when viewed from above using aerial or satellite imagery.
    -   ETC % = tree canopy / land area
-   Possible Tree Canopy - Vegetated: Grass or shrub area that is theoretically available for the establishment of tree canopy.
    -   e.g. residential areas
-   Possible Tree Canopy - Impervious: Asphalt, concrete or bare soil surfaces, excluding roads and buildings, that are theoretically available for the establishment of tree canopy without having to remove paved surfaces
    -   e.g. any areas with no trees, buildings, roads, or bodies of water
    -   Possible-Vegetation category should serve as a guide for further analysis, not a prescription of where to plant trees since other factors, such as land use, social, and financial (e.g. golf courses, agricultural and recreational fields), are involved.
-   Not Suitable: Areas where it is highly unlikely that new tree canopy could be established (primarily buildings and roads).
-   Relative tree canopy change - change of tree canopy over a period of time
    -   e.g (for 1 hexagon) relative tree canopy change % = (tree_canopy_area_2019 - tree_canopy_area_2012) / tree_canopy_area_2012 - Acre gain per <category>
-   Canopy height - proxy for tree age
    -   Steps
        -   Segment tree canopy into polygons approximating individual trees
        -   Attribute each polygon with a height from both the starting date to end date (e.g. 2012 and 2019 ) LiDAR data
    -   Interpretation example
        -   Trees in the 0-60 foot height class experienced gain, while there was minimal gain in the other taller height classes.
            -   Therefore, many new trees planted and canopy expanding on existing trees.
            -   Diverse height structure corresponds to a healthy and diverse tree age distribution
            -   Very mature trees in the 130 height class points to the height potential for certain tree species provided the right conditions

        -   Provides a new and scalable method to assign green indices to individual street segments.
        -   Offers a comprehensive solution by facilitating green index quantification, analysis, and visualization.
        -   Supports Mapbox visualizations for interactive exploration of different types of geospatial data, enhancing the analysis with dynamic and engaging visual tools.
-   Notes from [Lousiville Tree Canopy Assessment 2012-2019](https://treeslouisville.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Louisville-Tree-Canopy-Assessment-Report-2012-2019-Draft3.pdf)
-   Tree benefit: reducing stormwater runoff near streets and decreasing the urban heat island effect
-   Above surface factors such as sidewalks to utilities can affect the suitability of a site for tree planting.
-   Important to preserve trees in the 10-50 foot height range, so they can grow into the 60+ foot range while planting a variety of new trees to continue the lifecycle
-   Losses are generally easier to detect than gains as losses tend to be due to a large event, such as tree removal, whereas gains are incremental growth or new tree plantings, both of which are smallerin size
-   Factors that can affect change in tree canopy
    -   Natural
        -   Invasive species
        -   Natural disasters such as storms
        -   Climate change may cause trees to grow more quickly but could also result in inhospitable conditions for native species
    -   Anthropogenic
        -   Preservation and conservation efforts, the strength of tree ordinances, and the impacts of new development
        -   Tree removal due to homeowner preferences and not being replaced by new trees
        -   Proximity to roads: Regular salting, compaction, limited space, clearance pruning, and plow collisions
-   Data sources
    -   LiDAR
        -   Features distinguished by their spectral (color) properties
        -   Trees and shrubs can appear spectrally similar or obscured by shadow, LiDAR, which consists of 3D height information enhances the accuracy of the mapping
        -   Resolution of 30-meters
        -   "LiDAR datasets were acquired under leaf-off conditions and thus tend to underestimate tree canopy slightly" (i.e. Fall or Winter?)
        -   LiDAR and imagery datasets are not directly comparable due to differences in the sensor, time of acquisition, and processing techniques employed.
